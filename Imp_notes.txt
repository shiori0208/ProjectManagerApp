Open terminal >> npm init - to make jason file of project based on your inputs

The "main" key is expecting a page "index.js" 
We can run this differently by assigning command inside jason file under "scripts"
Instead of running 'node index.js' on terminal 
we assign this command to "test" (renamed to dev/random) and then run: 'npm run dev'

"type" in jason gives us 'commonjs' or 'module' option 
>>to use require keyword use commonjs
>>to use import use module 

[The git that we make using commands is a local repo - it doesn't appear in github unless we push it]
